Can I compute ET as a functional by int(ET(p) density(p) dp)?

Entropy invariance

AIC <--> Occam's razor

Deleeuw (paper in Unsorted papers/AIC) states that minus log-likelihood converges to relative entropy if law of large numbers applies.

Entropy, AIC for compartmental systems based on path distribution, candidate for a proposal

Journal: maybe SBB if I point out the difficulty of prediction based on entropy in soil systems

Try out a compressed dictionary as effective complexity of a CS (pickle-zip, compare with the other approaches in the notebook/block).
Try AIC (maxmimum entropy model with N pools) minus the purely deterministic part (0s and 1s) in the jump chain.
The purely deterministic part is something like effective complexity.
Create randomly CSs and try out things.

Göran Ågren on the maximum entropy principle in the Q model. So obvious...

Compute the entropy of the FORMAS model and the entropy of different submodules (tree, soil, WP). Where's the bottle neck?

AIC paper: also use model complexity as topic, use Fig. 4.6 (thesis).
